# hello-world
first app development
I'm a noob wanting to see the insides of an iOS app.  Having been associated with computing since the first 8088 was
introduced in the original IBM PC (yes, I'm that old), I am curious how programming has evolved.
My latest venture in programming has been on the Microsoft platform using Visual Basic, some web development, and a SQL
background.
My hobbies include playing bass guitar (I was in a band), bass and crappie fishing, and shooting sports (both rifle and
pistol).  Oh, by the way, I also enjoy PC's!  In fact, this entire scenario is being played out in a VMWare virtual Mac
machine.
This a a commit message explaning a bit of myself.
